      Comprehensive analysis for validating TNM staging system improvements using state-of-the-art 
      statistical methods. This analysis provides pathologists with robust tools to evaluate whether 
      a new staging system provides superior prognostic discrimination compared to existing systems.
      
      Includes advanced metrics: Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI), Integrated Discrimination 
      Improvement (IDI), time-dependent ROC analysis, decision curve analysis, bootstrap validation, 
      and comprehensive clinical interpretation guidance.
