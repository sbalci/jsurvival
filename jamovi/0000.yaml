      Performs survival analysis for a single cohort of patients without group
      comparisons. The analysis calculates total person-time follow-up (the sum
      of all individual  observation periods) and uses this to derive accurate
      survival estimates that account  for varying follow-up durations. Use this
      when you want to analyze overall survival  characteristics of your entire
      study population - for example, to determine median  survival time or
      1/3/5-year survival rates for all patients collectively.

      Performs univariate survival analysis comparing survival between groups.
      This analysis  calculates person-time follow-up for each group and uses
      this to derive accurate  survival estimates and incidence rates that
      account for varying follow-up durations  across groups. The Cox
      proportional hazards model incorporates person-time by modeling  the
      hazard function, which represents the instantaneous event rate per unit of
      person-time.

    description: >-
      Performs multivariable survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards
      regression. In multivariable survival analysis, person-time follow-up is
      crucial for properly adjusting for covariates while accounting for varying
      observation periods. The Cox proportional hazards model incorporates
      person-time by modeling the hazard function, which represents the
      instantaneous event rate per unit of person-time. When stratifying
      analyses or examining multiple predictors, the model accounts for how
      these factors influence event rates relative to the person-time at risk in
      each subgroup.

      Advanced time interval calculator designed for survival analysis,
      epidemiological studies,  and person-time analysis. Features intelligent
      date parsing, comprehensive data quality  assessment, landmark analysis,
      and robust statistical summaries. Time intervals form the  foundation of
      person-time follow-up calculations, capturing both participant counts and
      observation duration for accurate incidence rate calculations.
