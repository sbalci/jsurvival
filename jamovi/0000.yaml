      Performs survival analysis for a single cohort of patients without group
      comparisons. The analysis calculates total person-time follow-up (the sum
      of all individual  observation periods) and uses this to derive accurate
      survival estimates that account  for varying follow-up durations. Use this
      when you want to analyze overall survival  characteristics of your entire
      study population - for example, to determine median  survival time or
      1/3/5-year survival rates for all patients collectively.

      Performs univariate survival analysis comparing survival between groups.
      This analysis  calculates person-time follow-up for each group and uses
      this to derive accurate  survival estimates and incidence rates that
      account for varying follow-up durations  across groups. The Cox
      proportional hazards model incorporates person-time by modeling  the
      hazard function, which represents the instantaneous event rate per unit of
      person-time.

    description: >-
      Performs multivariable survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards
      regression. In multivariable survival analysis, person-time follow-up is
      crucial for properly adjusting for covariates while accounting for varying
      observation periods. The Cox proportional hazards model incorporates
      person-time by modeling the hazard function, which represents the
      instantaneous event rate per unit of person-time. When stratifying
      analyses or examining multiple predictors, the model accounts for how
      these factors influence event rates relative to the person-time at risk in
      each subgroup.

      Convert datetime variables to standardized format and extract datetime
      components (year, month, day, hour, minute, day name, week number,
      quarter, etc.). Features automatic format detection, quality assessment,
      and preview of converted data. Perfect for preparing datetime data for
      analysis and creating time-based variables.

      Advanced time interval calculator designed for survival analysis,
      epidemiological studies,  and person-time analysis. Features intelligent
      date parsing, comprehensive data quality  assessment, landmark analysis,
      and robust statistical summaries. Time intervals form the  foundation of
      person-time follow-up calculations, capturing both participant counts and 
      observation duration for accurate incidence rate calculations.
