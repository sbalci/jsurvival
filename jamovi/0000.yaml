      Performs survival analysis for a single cohort of patients without group
      comparisons. Use this when you want to analyze overall survival
      characteristics of your entire study population - for example, to
      determine median survival time or 1/3/5-year survival rates for all
      patients collectively. This differs from regular survival analysis which
      compares survival between groups.
