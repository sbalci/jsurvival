    description: >-
      Performs survival analysis for a single cohort of patients without group
      comparisons. The analysis calculates total person-time follow-up (the sum
      of all individual  observation periods) and uses this to derive accurate
      survival estimates that account  for varying follow-up durations. Use this
      when you want to analyze overall survival  characteristics of your entire
      study population - for example, to determine median  survival time or
      1/3/5-year survival rates for all patients collectively.

    description: >-
      Performs univariate survival analysis comparing survival between groups.
      This analysis  calculates person-time follow-up for each group and uses
      this to derive accurate  survival estimates and incidence rates that
      account for varying follow-up durations  across groups. The Cox
      proportional hazards model incorporates person-time by modeling  the
      hazard function, which represents the instantaneous event rate per unit of
      person-time.

    description: >-
      Performs multivariable survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards
      regression. In multivariable survival analysis, person-time follow-up is
      crucial for properly adjusting for covariates while accounting for varying
      observation periods. The Cox proportional hazards model incorporates
      person-time by modeling the hazard function, which represents the
      instantaneous event rate per unit of person-time. When stratifying
      analyses or examining multiple predictors, the model accounts for how
      these factors influence event rates relative to the person-time at risk in
      each subgroup.

    description: >-
      Calculates time intervals between dates or from pre-calculated values.
      Time intervals form the basis of person-time follow-up calculations in
      survival analysis. Person-time follows the accumulated time that
      participants contribute to a study while being at risk for the event of
      interest, accounting for varying entry times and censoring. Person-time is
      typically expressed in person-days, person-months,  or person-years
      depending on the study duration and outcome frequency.

    description: >-
      Comprehensive analysis for validating TNM staging system improvements
      using state-of-the-art  statistical methods. This analysis provides
      pathologists with robust tools to evaluate whether  a new staging system
      provides superior prognostic discrimination compared to existing systems.

      Includes advanced metrics: Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI),
      Integrated Discrimination  Improvement (IDI), time-dependent ROC analysis,
      decision curve analysis, bootstrap validation,  and comprehensive clinical
      interpretation guidance.
