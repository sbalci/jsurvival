    main: >-
      Performs survival analysis for a single cohort of patients without group comparisons.
      Use this when you want to analyze overall survival characteristics of your entire
      study population - for example, to determine median survival time or 1/3/5-year
      survival rates for all patients collectively. This differs from regular survival
      analysis which compares survival between groups.

            # Example analyzing overall survival for a patient cohort:

              outcome = "death_status",
              outcome_level = "Dead"

      description: >-
        The time-to-event or follow-up duration for each patient. Should be numeric and
        continuous, measured in consistent units (e.g., months or years). Can be calculated
        automatically from dates if using the date options below.

      description: >-
        Enable this option if you want to calculate survival time from dates in your data.
        This is useful when you have separate columns for diagnosis date and follow-up date
        and want to calculate the time elapsed between them.

      type: Variable
      description: >-
        The date of diagnosis or study entry for each patient. Should be in a consistent
        date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

      title: 'Follow-up Date'
      type: Variable
      description: >-
        The date of last follow-up or event for each patient. Should be in a consistent

      description: >-
        If enabled, the calculated time-to-event will be added to your data as a new
        variable. This is useful for verifying the accuracy of the calculated time.

        Enables landmark analysis, which addresses immortal time bias by analyzing survival
        only for patients who survive to a specified timepoint (the landmark). Use this when
        you want to eliminate the effect of early deaths or when comparing treatments that
        can only be given to patients who survive long enough to receive them.
