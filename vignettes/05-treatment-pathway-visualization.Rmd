## Introduction

The `alluvialSurvival()` function in ClinicoPath provides specialized visualization for patient treatment pathways over time, combining alluvial diagrams with survival analysis. This tool is particularly valuable for understanding how patients move through different disease stages and treatments, with the ability to incorporate survival outcomes.

Unlike static cross-sectional analyses, alluvial survival plots reveal the dynamic nature of patient care, showing:
- Disease progression and stage migrations
- Treatment sequence patterns
- Patient flow through different therapeutic interventions
- Survival outcomes associated with different pathways

This vignette demonstrates all features of the alluvialSurvival function using real clinical datasets.

## Loading Required Libraries and Data

```{r setup}
library(ClinicoPath)

# Load the treatment pathways dataset
data("treatment_pathways")

# Preview the data structure
str(treatment_pathways)
head(treatment_pathways)
```

## Data Requirements

The alluvialSurvival function requires longitudinal data with specific structure:

### Required Variables:
- **Time Variable**: Numeric time points (e.g., months, visits)
- **Stage Variable**: Disease stage at each time point (factor)
- **Treatment Variable**: Treatment received at each time point (factor)
- **Patient ID**: Unique identifier for tracking individual patients (factor)

### Optional Variables:
- **Survival Variable**: Binary outcome variable (0 = alive, 1 = dead)

### Data Structure:
- **Longitudinal format**: One row per patient per time point
- **Minimum requirements**: ≥5 patients, ≥2 time points
- **No missing values** in time or patient ID variables

## Basic Treatment Pathway Visualization

### Simple Pathway Analysis

```{r basic-pathway}
# Basic treatment pathway visualization
alluvialSurvival(
    data = treatment_pathways,
    timeVar = "Time",
    stageVar = "Disease_Stage", 
    treatmentVar = "Treatment",
    patientId = "ID"
)
```

### Understanding the Visualization

The alluvial plot shows:
- **Vertical strata**: Categories at each time point
- **Flows**: Patient transitions between categories
- **Width**: Proportional to number of patients
- **Colors**: Clinical color scheme by default

## Parameter Customization

### Color Schemes

The function provides two carefully designed color palettes:

```{r color-schemes}
# Clinical color scheme (default)
alluvialSurvival(
    data = treatment_pathways,
    timeVar = "Time",
    stageVar = "Disease_Stage",
    treatmentVar = "Treatment", 
    patientId = "ID",
    colorScheme = "clinical"
)

# Colorblind-safe palette
alluvialSurvival(
    data = treatment_pathways,
    timeVar = "Time",
    stageVar = "Disease_Stage",
    treatmentVar = "Treatment",
    patientId = "ID", 
    colorScheme = "colorblind"
)
```

### Percentage Axis

Add a secondary axis showing percentages:

```{r percentage-axis}
# Show percentage of patients on right axis
alluvialSurvival(
    data = treatment_pathways,
    timeVar = "Time",
    stageVar = "Disease_Stage",
    treatmentVar = "Treatment",
    patientId = "ID",
    showRightAxis = TRUE
)
```

## Survival Analysis Integration

### Basic Survival Statistics

When survival data is available, the function provides survival statistics:

```{r survival-stats}
# Add survival variable for statistics
alluvialSurvival(
    data = treatment_pathways,
    timeVar = "Time", 
    stageVar = "Disease_Stage",
    treatmentVar = "Treatment",
    patientId = "ID",
    survivalVar = "Survival_Status"
)
```

### Survival Curves

Enable survival curve visualization:

```{r survival-curves}
# Complete analysis with survival curves
alluvialSurvival(
    data = treatment_pathways,
    timeVar = "Time",
    stageVar = "Disease_Stage", 
    treatmentVar = "Treatment",
    patientId = "ID",
    survivalVar = "Survival_Status",
    showSurvival = TRUE
)
```

The survival plots show:
- **Kaplan-Meier curves** by initial disease stage
- **Risk tables** showing patients at risk
- **P-values** for comparing survival curves
- **Confidence intervals** for survival estimates

## Comprehensive Analysis

### All Features Combined

```{r comprehensive-analysis}
# Complete treatment pathway analysis
alluvialSurvival(
    data = treatment_pathways,
    timeVar = "Time",
    stageVar = "Disease_Stage",
    treatmentVar = "Treatment", 
    patientId = "ID",
    survivalVar = "Survival_Status",
    showRightAxis = TRUE,
    colorScheme = "colorblind",
    showSurvival = TRUE
)
```

## Advanced Examples

### Cancer Treatment Progression

```{r cancer-progression}
# Focus on cancer stage progression
alluvialSurvival(
    data = treatment_pathways,
    timeVar = "Time",
    stageVar = "Disease_Stage",
    treatmentVar = "Treatment",
    patientId = "ID",
    survivalVar = "Survival_Status",
    colorScheme = "clinical"
)
```

### Treatment Sequence Analysis

```{r treatment-sequences}
# Analyze treatment sequences with outcomes
alluvialSurvival(
    data = treatment_pathways,
    timeVar = "Time", 
    stageVar = "Disease_Stage",
    treatmentVar = "Treatment",
    patientId = "ID",
    survivalVar = "Survival_Status",
    showRightAxis = TRUE,
    showSurvival = TRUE
)
```

2. **Consistent Coding**: Use consistent factor levels across time points
3. **Missing Data**: Handle missing values appropriately before analysis
4. **Time Points**: Use meaningful time intervals (e.g., months, quarters)

### Visualization Guidelines
1. **Color Scheme**: Choose based on audience (clinical vs. colorblind-safe)
2. **Sample Size**: Function works best with 20-500 patients
3. **Time Points**: Optimal with 3-6 time points
4. **Categories**: Limit to 3-6 categories per variable for clarity

### Clinical Applications
1. **Treatment Protocols**: Evaluate standard vs. experimental pathways
2. **Disease Progression**: Track stage migration patterns
3. **Outcome Analysis**: Combine pathways with survival outcomes
4. **Quality Improvement**: Identify optimal treatment sequences

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### "Data must contain at least 2 time points"
- Ensure longitudinal data structure
- Check time variable has multiple unique values

#### "Data must contain at least 5 patients"  
- Increase sample size for meaningful analysis
- Consider aggregating similar groups

#### "Survival variable must be binary (0/1)"
- Recode survival variable to 0 (alive) and 1 (dead)
- Handle missing values appropriately

#### "Time variable cannot contain missing values"
- Remove or impute missing time values
- Ensure complete follow-up data

## Advanced Use Cases

### Multi-Center Studies

```{r multi-center}
# Analyze pathways across different centers
# (assuming center variable exists)
if ("Center" %in% names(treatment_pathways)) {
    # Subset by center for comparison
    center_data <- treatment_pathways[treatment_pathways$Center == "A", ]
    
    alluvialSurvival(
        data = center_data,
        timeVar = "Time",
        stageVar = "Disease_Stage",
        treatmentVar = "Treatment",
        patientId = "ID",
        survivalVar = "Survival_Status",
        showSurvival = TRUE
    )
}
```

### Subgroup Analysis

```{r subgroup-analysis}
# Analyze by age groups or other demographics
if ("Age" %in% names(treatment_pathways)) {
    # Create age groups
    treatment_pathways$AgeGroup <- cut(
        treatment_pathways$Age, 
        breaks = c(0, 65, Inf), 
        labels = c("≤65", ">65")
    )
    
    # Analyze younger patients
    young_patients <- treatment_pathways[treatment_pathways$AgeGroup == "≤65", ]
    
    alluvialSurvival(
        data = young_patients,
        timeVar = "Time",
        stageVar = "Disease_Stage", 
        treatmentVar = "Treatment",
        patientId = "ID",
