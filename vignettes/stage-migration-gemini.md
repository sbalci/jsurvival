# **A Comprehensive Guide to Comparing Cancer Staging Systems and Analyzing Stage Migration with R**

### **Introduction: The Evolving Landscape of Cancer Staging**

Cancer staging, fundamentally rooted in the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) system, serves as the cornerstone for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, prognosis estimation, and research stratification in oncology.1 The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) regularly updates its staging guidelines, typically every 6-8 years, reflecting advancements in diagnostic capabilities and understanding of tumor biology.1 Pathologists, at the forefront of this evolution, play a critical role in refining these systems by identifying new prognostic factors and developing more precise classifications. Proposing and validating a new staging system is a complex endeavor that demands rigorous statistical methodology and a deep understanding of its clinical implications. This report aims to provide a comprehensive guide for pathologists on comparing existing and proposed staging systems, detailing the appropriate statistical methods for developing new stages, and elucidating the intricacies of stage migration analysis, all with practical implementation guidance in R.

### **Statistical Framework for Comparing Cancer Staging Systems**

Comparing cancer staging systems necessitates a multi-faceted statistical approach that goes beyond simple predictive accuracy. It involves assessing a system's ability to discriminate between patients with different outcomes, to reclassify patients more appropriately, and to demonstrate tangible clinical utility.

#### **Assessing Discriminatory Ability**

Discriminatory ability refers to how well a staging system can differentiate between patients who will experience an event (e.g., death, recurrence) and those who will not, or between patients with shorter versus longer survival times.

* Concordance Index (C-index):  
  The C-index, or Harrell's C-index, is a widely adopted measure of a prognostic model's discriminatory power for time-to-event outcomes.1 It quantifies the probability that, for any randomly selected pair of patients, the patient with the worse predicted outcome (e.g., higher risk score or more advanced stage) actually experiences the event earlier or has a shorter survival time. A C-index value of 0.5 indicates no discrimination, akin to random chance, whereas a value of 1.0 signifies perfect discrimination.4 In clinical oncology, an improvement in the C-index of 0.02 or more is generally considered to be clinically meaningful.4 For instance, a prognostic nomogram developed for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients demonstrated C-index values of 0.668 for the training cohort and 0.670 for the validation cohort, which were notably higher than those for the AJCC staging system (0.590 and 0.578, respectively), indicating superior predictive performance.1 Similarly, a novel lymph node staging system (LODDS) for distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA) achieved a C-index of 0.679, surpassing the AJCC 7th and 8th N systems.5  
  For implementation in R, the survival package is commonly used to compute the C-index for Cox proportional hazards models. More specialized packages, such as SurvMetrics, offer comprehensive C-index calculations for both untied and tied survival data, addressing complexities in real-world datasets.6 Additionally, the  
  ClinicoPath package provides C-index calculation functionalities, including the estimation of bootstrap confidence intervals, which are crucial for robust statistical inference.4  
* Time-dependent Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC):  
  While traditional AUC is typically applied to binary outcomes, time-dependent AUC extends this concept to survival data, enabling the assessment of discriminatory power at specific clinically relevant time points, such as 1-year, 3-year, or 5-year survival.3 This metric represents the probability that, for a randomly chosen patient who experiences the event by a specified time point, the model will assign a higher predicted risk than to a randomly chosen patient who does not experience the event by that same time point. An AUC value closer to 1 indicates superior predictive performance.5 For example, the LODDS lymph node staging system exhibited higher 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year AUC values (0.739, 0.671, and 0.658, respectively) compared to the AJCC N systems, further substantiating its enhanced predictive capability.5 The  
  ClinicoPath package in R supports the execution of time-dependent ROC analysis, facilitating the evaluation of staging systems across various temporal horizons.4

#### **Quantifying Reclassification and Discrimination Improvement**

Beyond overall discriminatory ability, it is imperative to quantify how a new staging system reclassifies patients into different risk categories and improves the separation of predicted probabilities, thereby offering a more granular understanding of its clinical impact.

* Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI):  
  The Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) is a metric designed to quantify the net gain in correct risk classification when comparing a new prognostic model or staging system against an existing one.1 It assesses whether patients who experience the event of interest (e.g., death, recurrence) are correctly reclassified into a higher risk category, and conversely, whether those who do not experience the event are correctly reclassified into a lower risk category. A positive NRI value indicates a net improvement in reclassification accuracy.5 From a clinical perspective, an NRI value exceeding 0.20 (20%) is generally considered clinically significant, while an NRI greater than 0.60 (60%) suggests a substantial improvement in patient risk stratification.4 For instance, the LODDS system demonstrated positive 5-year NRI values (e.g., 0.042 when compared to the AJCC 8th N system), indicating its enhanced ability to differentiate between high- and low-risk dCCA patients post-surgery, particularly for those initially classified as high risk by the older system.5 The  
  ClinicoPath and SurvMetrics packages in R provide functionalities for calculating NRI, aiding in the quantitative assessment of reclassification benefits.4  
* Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI):  
  The Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) is another crucial metric that measures the overall improvement in the discriminatory ability when comparing two prognostic models or staging systems.1 Unlike NRI, IDI focuses on the continuous risk predictions, quantifying how much the new model increases the average difference in predicted probabilities between individuals who experience the event and those who do not.5 A positive IDI value suggests that the new model provides better overall discrimination across the entire spectrum of predicted risks.5 Clinically, an IDI value greater than 0.02 is considered meaningful, with values exceeding 0.05 indicating substantial improvement.4 The LODDS system, for example, showed positive 5-year IDI values (e.g., 0.020 when compared to the AJCC 8th N system), which further corroborated its superior predictive accuracy.5 Both the  
  ClinicoPath and SurvMetrics packages in R are equipped to calculate IDI, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of prediction model improvements.4

#### **Evaluating Clinical Utility**

Beyond statistical performance metrics, the true value of a new staging system is ultimately determined by its ability to effectively guide clinical decisions and improve patient outcomes. This necessitates an evaluation of its clinical utility.

* Calibration Plots:  
  Calibration assesses the agreement between a model's predicted risks and the observed event rates within the study cohort.1 A calibration plot visually represents this agreement by comparing predicted probabilities (e.g., the 5-year survival probability assigned to a particular stage) against the actual observed survival rates within that stage. In an ideally calibrated model, the plotted points or curve should closely align with the diagonal line of perfect calibration, where predicted risk precisely matches observed risk.10 Deviations from this diagonal line are indicative of miscalibration: points falling above the line suggest under-prediction (the model consistently predicts a lower risk than what is observed), while points below the line indicate over-prediction (the model consistently predicts a higher risk than observed).10  
  The importance of robust calibration cannot be overstated; miscalibrated models can lead to inaccurate risk estimates and, consequently, suboptimal clinical decision-making.11 For instance, a study evaluating a multistate model for blood cancer patients found extremely poor calibration for predictions related to relapse risk, leading to the conclusion that the model should not be used for informing risk estimation for that specific outcome.10 This underscores that even models with high discriminatory power can be clinically misleading if they are not well-calibrated.  
  In R, the ClinicoPath package can generate calibration plots for staging system evaluation.4 For more advanced calibration assessment, particularly in complex multistate models, the  
  calibmsm package is specifically designed to produce detailed calibration curves and scatter plots.10 Furthermore, the  
  survival package and its extensions offer functionalities for plotting calibration curves in the context of Cox proportional hazards models.7  
* Decision Curve Analysis (DCA):  
  Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) is a powerful methodology that evaluates the clinical utility of a prognostic model or staging system by quantifying its "net benefit" across a range of "threshold probabilities".1 The threshold probability represents the minimum predicted probability of an event at which a clinician or patient would choose to intervene (e.g., initiate treatment or recommend a biopsy).12 The net benefit metric integrates the benefits (true positives, e.g., correctly identifying patients who need treatment) and harms (false positives, e.g., unnecessary interventions) of a clinical decision onto a common scale, thereby incorporating the preferences of patients or policy-makers.12  
  The visual interpretation of DCA involves plotting the net benefit (on the y-axis) against the threshold probability (on the x-axis). A model or staging system demonstrates superior clinical utility if its net benefit curve is consistently higher than both the "treat all" and "treat none" curves over a clinically relevant range of threshold probabilities.12 For example, the LODDS system for lymph node staging showed a greater net benefit in DCA compared to other lymph node staging systems, unequivocally demonstrating its superior clinical utility in prognostic predictions for dCCA.5 This analysis moves beyond purely statistical metrics to provide a direct assessment of the clinical value of a new staging system in guiding real-world medical decisions.  
  In R, the dcurves and DecisionCurve packages are specifically developed for performing DCA, supporting both binary and time-to-event endpoints.14 The  
  ClinicoPath package also offers integrated DCA functionality within its staging system evaluation tools.4

### **Developing and Proposing a New Cancer Staging System**

The process of developing and proposing a new cancer staging system is a methodical undertaking that extends beyond simply identifying novel prognostic factors. It involves a systematic approach to group patients, define risk strata, and ensure the robustness and generalizability of the proposed classification.

#### **Principles of Model Development for Staging Systems**

When developing a new staging system, the primary objective is to create a classification that accurately predicts patient outcomes, typically survival.

* **Cox Proportional Hazards Model:** The Cox proportional hazards model is a cornerstone in survival analysis and is frequently employed for developing prognostic models based on censored survival data.3 It allows for the assessment of the magnitude of effect of various covariates on the hazard of an event. While powerful for understanding individual risk factors, the partial likelihood function derived from a Cox model may not always be the most desirable primary criterion for developing a  
  *staging system*.3 Staging systems are inherently categorical and aim to define discrete prognostic groups. Therefore, measures that directly assess the prognostic ability of these classification schemes, rather than continuous hazard ratios, are often more suitable.3 This shift in emphasis from continuous effect magnitude to clear prognostic stratification is critical for clinical applicability.  
* **Landmark Measures:** An appealing simplification in survival data analysis for staging system development involves the use of "landmark" time-points, such as 5-year or 10-year survival.3 This approach converts the complex censored survival outcome into a binary outcome (e.g., alive or dead at 5 years), which can be easier to interpret and communicate clinically.3 Landmark measures, such as the explained variation (π̂) and the area under the ROC curve (Â) at a specific time point, quantify the prognostic power of candidate staging systems.3 While statistically less efficient than utilizing the entire survival distribution, landmark analyses are often preferred for scientific reasons, particularly when proportionality of hazards is violated or when a specific "cure rate" at a given time is the primary clinical interest.3 This method facilitates direct comparison of survival probabilities across different stages at a fixed, clinically meaningful time horizon.  
* **Concordance Probability (Generalized C-index):** A measure generalized from Harrell's C-index, known as concordance probability (K̂), is also employed to assess the prognostic power of candidate staging systems.3 This metric represents the probability that, for a randomly selected pair of participants, the individual who experiences the event first has the worse prognosis as predicted by the model. This generalized estimator offers an improvement over the traditional Harrell's C-index by accounting for all pairs of observations, including those where the survival time ordering is uncertain due to censoring, making it particularly robust in datasets with high censoring rates.3 Its focus on ranks makes it less sensitive to outliers, which is advantageous in clinical data.

#### **Systematic Selection Methods for Optimal Stage Grouping**

The development of a new staging system often involves identifying optimal groupings of existing TNM categories or new prognostic factors. This is not a simple task of fitting a single model but rather a systematic search across numerous potential classifications.

* Bootstrap Model/Cutpoint Selection:  
  A novel and robust approach for developing cancer staging systems involves a bootstrap-based model/cutpoint selection method that maximizes chosen statistical criteria.3 This method aims to define an orderly, progressive condensation of T (primary tumor) and N (lymph node) categories, or other continuous prognostic factors, into an overall staging system that optimizes prognostic ability. The process begins by defining eligible staging systems, often constrained by partial ordering rules (e.g., T given N, and vice versa). A search algorithm then generates candidate systems, adhering to pre-specified criteria such as a minimum stage size (e.g., 5% of the sample size) to ensure statistical stability and clinical relevance.3  
  Bootstrap sampling plays a crucial role in this process. By drawing numerous bootstrap samples (e.g., 500-1000) with replacement from the original data, the method calculates a bootstrap-estimated criterion for each candidate system, which is the average of the criterion values obtained from each replication.3 The optimal staging system is then defined as the one that maximizes this bootstrap-estimated criterion. This resampling approach is valuable because it provides robust inference procedures, including confidence intervals for all candidate systems, allowing researchers to examine their relative performance and make informed decisions.3 It also offers adaptability to incorporate any measure of prognostic ability deemed appropriate.  
* Addressing Maximization Bias:  
  A critical consideration in systematic model selection, particularly when searching for an "optimal" staging system by maximizing a criterion, is the potential for maximization bias. This bias can lead to an overly optimistic assessment of the selected model's performance when compared to fixed, pre-existing models (like the current AJCC system) without proper adjustment.3 To mitigate this, cross-validation techniques are employed. A common approach is 10-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is randomly partitioned into 10 subsets. Nine-tenths of the data are used to select the optimal system (the "training" set), and the performance of this selected system is then evaluated on the remaining one-tenth (the "test" set).3 This process is repeated 10 times, ensuring that each patient is included in a test set exactly once. The estimated criteria are then computed under this cross-validation adjusted staging assignment, providing a more realistic and less biased estimate of the system's true performance and generalizability.3 This rigorous internal validation is paramount to ensure the robustness of the newly proposed staging system.

#### **Optimal Cut-point Determination for Continuous Prognostic Factors**

Many prognostic factors, such as tumor size, lymph node counts, or biomarker levels, are continuous variables. To integrate these into a categorical staging system, optimal cut-points must be determined to define distinct risk groups.

* Minimum p-value Approach:  
  One widely used method for estimating an optimal cut-point for a continuous covariate in relation to an outcome is the minimum p-value approach, also known as the maximum statistic approach.18 This technique involves performing a series of two-sample tests for multiple possible dichotomizations of the continuous variable. For each candidate cut-point within a specified selection interval (often excluding the outer 10-20% of the distribution to avoid small group sizes and maintain statistical power), an appropriate two-sample test (e.g., log-rank test for survival outcomes) is conducted, yielding a test statistic and p-value.18 The optimal cut-point is then defined as the candidate cut-point that yields the smallest p-value, indicating the strongest statistical association with the outcome. This method is considered conservative, meaning only strong relationships between the dichotomized covariate and outcome are likely to be deemed statistically significant.18  
* R Packages for Optimal Cut-point Selection:  
  Several R packages facilitate the determination of optimal cut-points for continuous variables, particularly in the context of survival data. The survminer package, through its surv\_cutpoint() function, utilizes the maximally selected rank statistics from the maxstat R package.19 This outcome-oriented method identifies a cut-point that corresponds to the most significant relationship with survival. For example, it can be used to determine optimal thresholds for gene expression data to stratify patients into low and high-risk groups.19  
  Another versatile R package is cutpointr, which offers a tidy framework for calculating optimal cut-points in binary classification tasks, including methods applicable to survival outcomes.20 It supports various methods for calculating cut-points (e.g., maximizing Youden's Index, accuracy, sensitivity+specificity) and includes functionalities for bootstrapping the variability of optimal cut-points and returning out-of-bag estimates of performance metrics.20 This allows for a more robust assessment of the chosen cut-point's generalizability beyond the immediate sample. The ability to systematically identify and validate such cut-points is crucial for ensuring that the boundaries between stages are prognostically meaningful and clinically actionable.

### **Stage Migration Analysis**

Stage migration, also known as the Will Rogers phenomenon, is a critical concept in cancer epidemiology and prognosis. It describes a statistical artifact where an apparent improvement in survival rates for all stages of a disease occurs, not due to actual improvements in treatment or patient outcomes, but due to changes in diagnostic or staging methodologies.21

#### **Definition and Causes (The Will Rogers Phenomenon)**

The Will Rogers phenomenon occurs when advancements in diagnostic technology or changes in staging criteria lead to a reclassification of patients from one stage to another.21 The most common cause is the increased sensitivity in detecting tumor spread, particularly lymph node metastases or distant micrometastases.

* **Improved Detection:** For instance, in colon cancer, an inadequate lymph node harvest during pathology examination can lead to understaging, where cases with undetected metastases are incorrectly classified as node-negative (Stage I/II) instead of node-positive (Stage III).21 Conversely, a higher number of evaluated lymph nodes, driven by improved pathological techniques or adherence to guidelines (e.g., at least 12 lymph nodes for colon cancer), can prevent this understaging by detecting previously missed positive nodes.21 Similarly, the introduction of more sensitive imaging modalities like PET/CT can lead to the detection of previously occult metastases, resulting in "upstaging" of patients who would have been classified into lower stages by conventional methods.22 For example, a study on NSCLC stage III patients showed that PET/CT led to upstaging in 13% of patients and downstaging in 3%, resulting in a 16% stage migration.22  
* **Impact on Stage Distribution:** When previously understaged patients (with inherently poorer prognoses) are correctly reclassified into higher stages, the average prognosis of both the "old" lower stage and the "new" higher stage can appear to improve. The lower stage improves because the sicker patients have been removed, and the higher stage improves because it now includes patients who, while having more advanced disease than previously thought, are still relatively healthier than the patients already in that higher stage.21 This mathematical shift creates an illusion of progress in survival for all stages.

#### **Implications for Survival Statistics and Comparative Studies**

The stage migration effect has profound implications for the interpretation of cancer survival statistics and the conduct of comparative studies.

* **Misleading Survival Improvement:** The primary implication is the creation of a misleading impression of improved survival rates across all stages, even in the absence of actual advancements in treatment efficacy or patient care.21 This can lead to an overestimation of treatment benefits or an inaccurate perception of disease progression trends. For a pathologist, understanding this phenomenon is crucial when reviewing historical survival data or comparing outcomes across different institutions or time periods. An apparent improvement in survival might not reflect better clinical management but rather a change in diagnostic rigor.  
* **Challenges in Comparative Studies:** Stage migration poses significant challenges for comparative studies, particularly those evaluating treatment efficacy or prognostic factors over time or across different healthcare settings.21 If the methodology for staging (e.g., lymph node examination protocols, imaging techniques) changes between study cohorts or differs between institutions, the survival statistics might not be truly comparable. A new staging system, even if statistically superior in discrimination, could induce stage migration, making direct comparisons with historical cohorts problematic without careful adjustment. For instance, the transition from AJCC TNM-7 to TNM-8 for papillary thyroid cancer led to a significant number of patients being reclassified to lower stages, which then provided more accurate survival predictions.23 However, this reclassification means that direct comparisons of survival rates between TNM-7 and TNM-8 cohorts require careful consideration of the stage shifts.23

#### **Alternative Explanations and Nuance**

While understaging due to inadequate lymph node harvest is a widely accepted explanation for stage migration, particularly concerning lymph node count and prognosis, some researchers have questioned whether it is the sole or complete explanation.21

* **Immune Response Hypothesis:** An alternative hypothesis suggests that the number of evaluated lymph nodes might not solely reflect the thoroughness of pathological examination but could also be a surrogate marker for the patient's immune response against the tumor.21 A robust immunologic reaction against the tumor might lead to local lymph node hyperplasia, resulting in larger and more easily detectable lymph nodes. In this scenario, a higher lymph node yield would correlate with a stronger host immune response and, consequently, a better prognosis, independent of whether metastases were missed.21 This biological perspective adds a critical layer of nuance, suggesting that the prognostic impact of lymph node count may stem from a complex interplay of pathological thoroughness and intrinsic tumor-host biology. This implies that pathologists should consider not only the quantity but also the qualitative aspects of lymph node involvement and the broader immune microenvironment.  
* **Evidence Against Sole Understaging:** Several arguments have been put forth that challenge understaging as the exclusive reason for the prognostic impact of lymph node yield. These include observations that despite continuous increases in evaluated lymph nodes over decades, the rate of node-positive cases has remained relatively constant in many studies. Furthermore, analyses have shown no consistent association between inadequate lymph node yields and lymph node positivity rates. Upstaging upon re-evaluation is often restricted to cases with very poor initial harvests, and advanced dissection techniques do not consistently lead to higher rates of Stage III cancers. Moreover, the prognostic impact of lymph node count has been observed even in Stage III cancers, where stage migration is inherently ruled out.21 These points collectively suggest that the phenomenon is more complex than a simple mathematical artifact and may involve underlying biological factors that influence both lymph node detectability and tumor behavior.

#### **Quantifying and Visualizing Stage Migration**

To effectively analyze and communicate the effects of stage migration, specific statistical methods and graphical tools are essential.

* **Migration Heatmap:** A migration heatmap is a powerful visual tool for quantifying stage migration. This matrix-based plot illustrates how patients are reclassified between an old staging system and a new proposed one. Rows typically represent the old stages, and columns represent the new stages. The cells of the heatmap show the number or percentage of patients who move from a specific old stage to a specific new stage, allowing for immediate identification of upstaging, downstaging, or stable classification patterns.4 This provides a clear, intuitive overview of the patient flow between systems.  
* **Will Rogers Analysis:** This specific visualization, often presented as Kaplan-Meier survival curves, helps to illustrate the "Will Rogers phenomenon" directly. It typically involves plotting survival curves for each stage under both the old and new staging systems. If stage migration is occurring, one might observe an apparent improvement in survival for both the lower and higher stages under the new system, even if individual patient prognoses have not changed.4 This visual comparison highlights the artificial inflation of survival statistics caused by reclassification.  
* **R Resources for Stage Migration Analysis:** The ClinicoPath package in R is a primary resource for performing advanced stage migration analysis.4 Its  
  stagemigration function provides state-of-the-art statistical methods for validating TNM staging system improvements. This function can generate migration heatmaps and perform Will Rogers analysis, among other evaluations. The package also includes comprehensive test datasets for various cancer types (e.g., lung, breast, colorectal cancer), which can be used to practice and understand the data structure required for such analyses.4 While other R packages like  
  migest and migrate exist for general migration data analysis, ClinicoPath is specifically tailored for the complexities of cancer staging system evaluation.

### **Validation Strategies for New Staging Systems**

The rigorous validation of a newly proposed cancer staging system is paramount to ensure its reliability, accuracy, and generalizability for clinical application. Validation typically involves both internal and external approaches.

* Internal Validation:  
  Internal validation assesses the performance of a model or staging system on the dataset from which it was derived. While essential, it can often lead to an overly optimistic estimate of performance due to overfitting to the specific characteristics of the development cohort.  
  * **Bootstrap Validation with Optimism Correction:** The bootstrap method is a powerful resampling technique used for internal validation. It involves repeatedly drawing samples with replacement from the original dataset to create multiple "bootstrap samples." The model is then developed or evaluated on each bootstrap sample, and its performance is assessed on the original dataset. By averaging the performance across many bootstrap replications and comparing it to the performance on the original data, an "optimism" estimate can be calculated. This optimism is then subtracted from the apparent performance to yield a more realistic, optimism-corrected estimate of the model's true performance.4 This method is particularly valuable for providing robust confidence intervals for various performance metrics.  
  * **Cross-validation:** Cross-validation, such as 10-fold cross-validation, is another robust internal validation technique, especially for larger datasets.4 The dataset is randomly divided into a specified number of folds (e.g., 10). The model is trained on a subset of the folds (e.g., 9 folds) and then validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated until each fold has served as the validation set. The performance metrics are then averaged across all iterations, providing a more stable and less biased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data from the same population.4  
* External Validation:  
  External validation is a critical step that assesses the generalizability and robustness of a new staging system by evaluating its performance on independent datasets from different patient populations or institutions.4 A staging system that performs well only on the data it was developed from may not be reliable in broader clinical practice.  
  * **Importance of Independent Cohorts:** External validation in independent cohorts helps to confirm that the system's predictive power is not merely a result of chance findings or peculiarities within the development dataset. It addresses whether the system can accurately predict outcomes in diverse patient demographics, clinical practices, and geographical regions.4 For example, studies comparing the AJCC TNM-7 and TNM-8 systems for papillary thyroid cancer often involve analyzing large, independent cohorts to validate the improved discriminatory power of the newer edition.23 The consistency of findings across multiple independent studies, as often seen in comprehensive literature reviews, serves as a form of external validation, strengthening the evidence for a new system's utility.23  
  * **Data Quality and Sample Size Considerations:** Regardless of the validation strategy, robust data preparation is fundamental. This includes ensuring adequate sample size (e.g., minimum 200 patients for basic analysis, 500 for reliable advanced metrics, and at least 100 events for stable survival results), verifying staging consistency, checking for missing data patterns, and validating event definitions.4 The use of clinically relevant time points and consideration of cancer-specific survival patterns are also crucial for meaningful validation.4

### **Beyond Statistics: Clinical Interpretability and Utility**

While statistical metrics provide a quantitative measure of a staging system's performance, its ultimate adoption and impact in clinical practice hinge on its interpretability and perceived clinical utility. A statistically superior system that is not understood or trusted by clinicians will have limited real-world application.

* The Need for Interpretability:  
  Many advanced predictive models, particularly those derived from machine learning algorithms, are often characterized as "black boxes" due to their complex internal workings.24 This lack of transparency can be a significant barrier to their widespread clinical adoption. Clinicians, including pathologists, need to understand not just  
  *what* a model predicts, but *why* it makes a particular prediction. Without this understanding, trust is diminished, and the integration of such models into routine clinical decision-making becomes challenging.24 A staging system, by its nature, must be transparent enough to inform treatment discussions, prognostication, and patient counseling.  
* Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for Model Transparency:  
  To address the interpretability challenge, methods like Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) have emerged as robust frameworks for explaining predictions from complex models.24 SHAP assigns a "SHAP value" to each feature for a given prediction, representing the contribution of that feature to the prediction relative to a baseline. This allows for both global (overall feature importance) and local (individual prediction explanation) interpretability.24  
  * **SHAP Summary Plots:** These plots illustrate the direction and magnitude of each feature's impact across the entire dataset. For instance, a SHAP summary plot might show that the presence of tumor emboli consistently increases the predicted probability of early liver metastasis (ELM) in PDAC patients, while adjuvant chemotherapy decreases it.24  
  * **SHAP Bar Plots:** These rank features by their average absolute SHAP values, providing a clear hierarchy of feature importance. For example, tumor embolus, N stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy were identified as the most significant factors influencing ELM prediction in PDAC.24  
  * **SHAP Dependence Plots:** These plots visualize the relationship between a single feature's value and its impact on the model's prediction, often revealing non-linear relationships or interactions. For instance, higher fatty liver values were correlated with lower SHAP values, suggesting a protective effect against ELM in PDAC.24  
  * **Individual Sample Force Plots:** These provide an intuitive visualization of how each feature pushes a specific patient's prediction higher or lower from the baseline, offering a personalized explanation for a given outcome.24

The implementation of SHAP allows pathologists and clinicians to gain actionable insights into the key factors driving a staging system's predictions, thereby facilitating more accurate and confident medical decisions.24 This bridges the gap between complex statistical models and practical clinical application.

* Practical Implementation and Clinical Decision Support:  
  The utility of a new staging system extends beyond its statistical and interpretative merits to its practical accessibility and integration into clinical workflows. Deploying predictive models, including new staging systems, on user-friendly online platforms or as integrated tools within electronic health records, significantly enhances their clinical utility.24 This translates research findings into tangible, real-time decision-making support. For example, an XGBoost model for predicting ELM after PDAC surgery was implemented as a freely accessible web calculator, providing clinicians with a visual tool to support personalized strategies.24 Such platforms can guide individualized surveillance planning, optimize treatment decisions, and ultimately improve patient outcomes by making complex prognostic information readily available and interpretable at the point of care.  
* Integration of Additional Prognostic Factors:  
  Modern cancer staging systems increasingly recognize that factors beyond the traditional TNM categories can significantly influence prognosis and treatment response.1 These additional prognostic variables can include patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, marital status, comorbidities), tumor biology (e.g., pathology grade, molecular alterations like BRAF gene mutation, tumor markers like CEA, histological differentiation), and treatment-related factors (e.g., surgery status, adjuvant therapies).1

  New staging systems can incorporate these elements to provide a more comprehensive and personalized risk assessment. For instance, inflammation-based biomarkers like neutrophil-to-albumin ratio (NAR) have shown independent prognostic value in various malignancies.26 Similarly, factors like vascular invasion, systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) have been identified as key predictors in colorectal cancer.25 The AJCC 8th edition already incorporated an age cut-off change to improve survival prediction in papillary thyroid cancer.23 By integrating these diverse factors, new staging systems can offer a more nuanced understanding of disease aggressiveness and patient prognosis, moving towards precision medicine by tailoring management pathways to individual patient risk profiles.25

### **Conclusions and Recommendations**

The development and validation of new cancer staging systems represent a continuous and critical endeavor in oncology. As diagnostic technologies advance and understanding of tumor biology deepens, pathologists are uniquely positioned to refine these classifications, which serve as the bedrock for patient management and research.

Comparing an old staging system with a new proposed one demands a rigorous, multi-faceted statistical approach. It extends beyond simple accuracy to encompass discriminatory ability (quantified by C-index and time-dependent AUC), reclassification improvement (measured by NRI and IDI), and, crucially, clinical utility (assessed through calibration plots and Decision Curve Analysis). These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive assessment of a new system's prognostic power and its capacity to enhance clinical decision-making. The R programming environment, with packages such as survival, SurvMetrics, ClinicoPath, dcurves, DecisionCurve, calibmsm, maxstat (via survminer), and cutpointr, offers a robust toolkit for performing these complex statistical analyses.

When proposing a new stage, the process involves systematic selection methods for optimal grouping of TNM categories or continuous prognostic factors. Techniques like bootstrap model selection, coupled with cross-validation for bias correction, are essential to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the derived staging criteria. The determination of optimal cut-points for continuous variables, often using minimum p-value approaches, is also a critical step in defining clear stage boundaries.

A thorough understanding of stage migration, or the Will Rogers phenomenon, is indispensable for pathologists. This statistical artifact, caused by improved detection methods or changes in staging criteria, can misleadingly inflate survival rates across stages. While often attributed to understaging, emerging evidence suggests that biological factors, such as host immune response, may also contribute to the prognostic impact of factors like lymph node count. Quantifying and visualizing stage migration through tools like migration heatmaps and Will Rogers analysis is vital for accurate interpretation of survival trends and for ensuring valid comparisons across different cohorts or time periods.

Finally, the clinical adoption of any new staging system hinges not only on its statistical superiority but also on its interpretability and practical utility. Addressing the "black-box" nature of complex predictive models through methods like Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is paramount for fostering clinician trust and facilitating informed decision-making. The deployment of new staging systems on accessible online platforms can further translate research findings into actionable clinical tools, supporting personalized treatment strategies and ultimately improving patient outcomes. The integration of additional prognostic factors beyond TNM, encompassing patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, holds significant promise for developing more precise and clinically impactful staging systems in the era of precision oncology.

**Recommendations for Pathologists:**

1. **Embrace Multi-Metric Evaluation:** When evaluating new staging systems, move beyond single metrics. Systematically assess discrimination (C-index, AUC), reclassification (NRI, IDI), and clinical utility (Calibration, DCA) to gain a holistic understanding of the system's performance.  
2. **Prioritize Rigorous Validation:** Always perform both internal (bootstrap with optimism correction, cross-validation) and external validation (on independent cohorts) to ensure the generalizability and robustness of any proposed staging system.  
3. **Account for Stage Migration:** Be acutely aware of the Will Rogers phenomenon. When comparing survival statistics across different staging eras or institutions, consider the potential for stage migration and utilize appropriate analytical and visualization tools to quantify its impact.  
4. **Focus on Interpretability and Clinical Actionability:** Develop staging systems that are not only statistically sound but also clinically interpretable. Leverage tools like SHAP to explain model predictions, fostering trust and facilitating the integration of new systems into routine clinical practice.  
5. **Integrate Comprehensive Prognostic Factors:** Explore and incorporate a broader range of prognostic factors beyond traditional TNM, including molecular markers, inflammatory profiles, and treatment response data, to develop more personalized and predictive staging systems.  
6. **Utilize R for Advanced Analysis:** Leverage the powerful statistical and visualization capabilities of R and its specialized packages for comprehensive analysis, development, and validation of cancer staging systems.
